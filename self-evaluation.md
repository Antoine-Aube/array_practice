## Self-evaluation questions

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
*I feel good! I was lucky to have time to learn a bit from some online resources before the course so I feel pretty solid on the basics of arrays.* 

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

*I don't think so. This is my first time diving into ruby docs and it's very clear documentation which is cool. There's a bit of the way things are explained that takes some getting used to but other than that I feel good!*

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?

*None as of now but I'm sure I'll have plenty in the near future. *
